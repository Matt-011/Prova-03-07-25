            <p>
                Let's get lost tonight
                You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
                Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
                And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
                Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
                Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
                I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
                Do anybody make real shit anymore?
                Bow in the presence of greatness
                'Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
                You should be honored by my lateness
                That I would even show up to this fake shit
                So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
                'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
                Act like you can't tell who made this
                New Gospel, homie, take six
                And take this, haters
