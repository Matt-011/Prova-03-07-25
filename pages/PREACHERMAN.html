            <h3>[Intro]</h3>
            <p>And I
            Ring that I hold, I—
            This ring that I hold, I—
            This ring that I hold, I give to you (To you with—)</p>

            <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
            <p>Break in, they ain't let us in
            We passed on the settlement
            This path, I don't recommend
            We passed what they expected, man</p>

            <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
            <p>I go where they never can
            I float, I don't ever land
            When it's dark, you don't know where you goin'
            Need a light-bearer to lead you home
            I go where they never can
            I float, I don't ever land
            When it's dark, you don't know where you goin'
            Need a light-bearer to lead you home</p>

            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            <p>Light 'em up, beam me up
            The only GOAT, the genius one
            They switchin' sides, I seen it comin'
            The plot twist, a convenient one
            See upcoming rap shows
            Get tickets for your favorite artists</p>

            <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
            <p>Look, nobody finna extort me
            Even when they record me, I'ma keep it more G
            Hand me a drink 'fore I get more deep
            She hate sports 'less she watchin' from the floor seats
            I hate that God didn't make a couple more of me
            And all my haters in the courts act accordingly
            They imitate the sound, call it forgery
            What we doing's more important, more importantly
            Look where we made it to
            Made love that's unmakeable, bonds is unbreakable
            Broke rules and bent corners in hopes of breaking through
            Basically, went out my way to make a way for you
            Basically, we finna take 'em higher places through it
            Way improved, and like a beta, we gon' stay improvin'
            This the light that's gon' illuminate the way we movin'
            Trust in me, we goin' God mode, the theory's proven</p>

            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            <p>Light 'em up, beam me up
            The only GOAT, the genius one
            They switchin' sides, I seen it comin'
            The plot twist, a convenient one</p>

            <h3>[Outro]</h3>
            <p>I walk up to the preacher man
