            <p>
                Did you realize
                That you were a champion in their eyes?
            </p>

            <h3>[Chorus: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, I did
                So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
                Just a lil' something, show ya how we live
                Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
                Mhm, that's that shit
                So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
            </p>

            <h3>[Refrain]</h3>
            <p>
                Did you realize
                That you were a champion in their eyes?
            </p>

            <h3>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
                You don't see just how fly my style is?
                I don't see why I need a stylist
                When I shop so much I can speak Italian
                I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
                And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
                But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
                My dad'd say, "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"
                We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
                In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
                'Cause every summer he'd get some
                Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
                And I don't know what he did for dough
                But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe, but ayy
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>[Chorus: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                I think he did
                When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
                Just a lil' somethin', show ya how we live
                Everything I wanted, man, it seem so serious
                Mhm, that's that shit
                So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

            <p>
                When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
                For me, givin' up's way harder than tryin'
                Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
                I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
                'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
                I guess me if it isn't you
                Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
                They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
                I guess I'll cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
                If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
                They got the CD, they got to see me
                Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
                They used to feel invisible
                Now, they know they invincible
            </p>
